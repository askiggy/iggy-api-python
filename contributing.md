# Contributing to Ask Iggy

Thanks for helping us make Iggy easier to use! We're excited to hear and learn from you. Your experiences will benefit others who read and use these guides.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful. <b>This guide has been largely adapted from the Open Source Guides on Github</b>

# Code of Conduct

Ask Iggy has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

# Types of contributions we're looking for

There are many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in descending order of need):

1. Fix editorial inconsistencies or inaccuracies
2. Add stories, examples, or anecdotes that help illustrate a point
3. Revise language to be more approachable and friendly
4. Translate guides into other languages
5. Interested in making a contribution? Read on!

# Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.

-   If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests.
-   If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

# How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

-   If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
-   If your contribution is major, such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
